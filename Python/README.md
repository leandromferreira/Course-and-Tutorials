   DataCamp is an online compiler learning platform, so i did not save the scripts that i did on the courses. I'll put a list of the complete tracks here. For a more complete list see the [DataCamp file](https://github.com/leandromferreira/Course-and-Tutorials/blob/master/Python/DataCamp_course.md) or my profile in the site. 

  The site also offers tutorials and projects for practice. I will put the notebooks in the [datacamp projects folder](https://github.com/leandromferreira/Course-and-Tutorials/tree/master/Python/DataCamp%20Projects) and the tutotials in [datacamp tutorials folder](https://github.com/leandromferreira/Course-and-Tutorials/tree/master/Python/DataCamp%20Tutorials).
